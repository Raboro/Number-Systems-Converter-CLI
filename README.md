## Install
Just use ''make'' in your terminal:
````bash
$ make
````

Or do it manually by using the following command in your terminal:
````bash
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -o ns.exe main.c
````
After that link it to your system. For example windows users need to add ``ns.exe`` to the system environment variables.
